== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I provide shipping rates from more than one shipping carrier simultaneously using this plugin..? =
Yes, absolutely. Once you enter the Shipping Carrier Account Details, you will get the real-time shipping rates from more than one shipping carrier simultaneously. 
= Which shipping carriers does this plugin support..? =
Currently this plugin only support UPS, FedEx, DHL, Stamps.com and USPS. However, we are constantly updating the plugin and we can choose to provide support for other shipping carriers in the future.
= How is this plugin different from the standalone UPS, FedEx or USPS shipping plugins..? =
All the standalone plugins offer real-time shipping rates from a single carrier. WooCommerce Multi-Carrier Shipping plugin offer real-time shipping rates from 5 different carriers simultaneously. Moreover, the plugin also combines the real-time shipping rates with the ability to assign different shipping services to an order based on the product quantity. And if that’s not enough, it also allows you to configure Flat-Rate and Free Shipping based on product quantity.
= Can I use this plugin only for Print label and charge the customers a flat rate I set? =
This plugin is meant for fetching real time rates. For label generation, you can use the individual shipping carrier plugins from here - https://www.xadapter.com/shop/
= Currently I have not measured or weighed my products. Can I still get rates? =
It is mandatory to put in product weight and dimensions while fetching the rates. 
= Will your Multi-carrier plugin work with the individual plugins like UPS & USPS? I want to generate label using the UPS plugin but want rates from multiple carriers =
Yes. You can always use any of our plugins in conjunction. They are compatible.
= I am not getting the rates from the plugin =
No worries. Just go to plugin settings page, enable the debug option. Once the debug is enabled, go to cart and place an order. In the cart page, you will see the request and response information. Copy them and send it to our support so that we can help you.
= I am always getting a fixed rate which is very high using the plugin. What may be the problem =
You may be getting the fallback rates in that case. To resolve the problem, enable the debug option. Once the debug is enabled, go to cart and place an order. In the cart page, you will see the request and response information. Copy them and send it to our support so that we can help you.
= What are Fallback Rates..? =
Incase the official shipping carrier’s API doesn’t return the shipping rates for a particular services, you can enable fallback rates and provide a value which will be displayed on the cart page instead of the real-time rates. Besides, the plugin also offers fallback rates based on the quantity of products in the cart.
